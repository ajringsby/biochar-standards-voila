# Biochar standards crosswalk (Voila + Binder)

This repo publishes a Voila dashboard version of `app.ipynb`.

## Launch (Binder + Voila)

After you push this repo to GitHub, your shareable launch link will be:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/HEAD?urlpath=voila/render/app.ipynb

Notes:
- First launch may take a bit (Binder builds the environment).
- Each user gets their own temporary session.
